## üìã Prerequisites

- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS  (officially supported)
- Dependencies: OpenSSL 3, GLibc 2.38+
- Environment: Any compatible Linux environment (VPS, local, cloud instance)

The installer officially supports 24.04 LTS x64. While it has also been tested
successfully on Ubuntu 24.10, official support is limited to the LTS version
listed above. Compatibility with other versions may vary.

The installer has modular OS logic support. See [Contributing OS Support](#contributing-os-support) to learn how to add support for your Linux distribution. 

## üì¶ Packages

The installer comes with the following packages:

- [Rusk](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk) service
- [Rusk wallet CLI](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/rusk-wallet/src/bin)

## üìÇ Folder layout

The configuration files, binaries, services and scripts can be found in
`/opt/dusk/`.

The log files can be found in `/var/log/rusk.log` and
`/var/log/rusk-recovery.log`.

## üîë Pre-Installation Setup

To securely manage your node, it's highly recommended to use a dedicated
non-root user (e.g., `duskadmin`). Before running the Node Installer, ensure you
have set up a dedicated user for managing your node and configured SSH access.
This user should be part of the `dusk` group to access node files and
configurations.

### Step 1: Create a Dedicated Group & User

Create a new non-root user (e.g., `duskadmin`), add them to the `dusk` group and
set a password for the new user:

```sh
sudo groupadd --system dusk
sudo useradd -m -G dusk -s /bin/bash duskadmin
sudo passwd duskadmin
```

### Step 2: Set Up SSH Access

Ensure the new user has access to your SSH keys for secure login. Add your
public key directly to the new user's `authorized_keys` file:

1. Edit or create the `authorized_keys` file for the new user:

```sh
mkdir -p /home/duskadmin/.ssh
sudo nano /home/duskadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

2. Paste your public SSH key (e.g., starting with `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`)
3. Save and set proper permissions:

```sh
sudo chmod 700 /home/duskadmin/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/duskadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown -R duskadmin:dusk /home/duskadmin/.ssh
```

### Step 3: Add `duskadmin` to the `sudo` Group

If not already done, log in as `root` or a user with sufficient privileges and
add `duskadmin` to the `sudo` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG sudo duskadmin
```

Log out from you node for the group changes to take effect.

### Step 4: Verify Access

Test SSH access to the new user account by connecting to the node with the new
account:

```sh
ssh duskadmin@<your-server-ip>
```

### Step 5: Firewall

It's important to setup a firewall. A firewall controls incoming and outgoing
traffic and ensures your system is protected.

You can use common tools like `ufw`, `iptables`, or `firewalld`. At a minimum,
the following ports should be open:

- The port you use for SSH (default: `22`)
- `9000/udp` for Kadcast (used for consensus messages)

If you're running an archive node or want to expose the HTTP server, you can
also open the corresponding TCP port (default: `8080`).

#### Configure with `ufw`

If you're using `ufw`, you can configure it with these commands:

```sh
# Allow SSH (default port 22)
sudo ufw limit ssh
# Allow Kadcast UDP traffic
sudo ufw allow 9000/udp
# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

For non-default SSH ports or other firewall tools, adjust the commands
accordingly.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

:information_source: To run the **latest release** of the Node Installer execute
the following command:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash
```

:warning: **CAUTION** To run the **not release yet** unstable version of the
Node Installer execute the following command:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusk-network/node-installer/main/node-installer.sh | sudo bash
```

### Networks

By default, the installer runs the node for our mainnet. If you'd like to run a
node for the Nocturne testnet or Lunare devnet, you can specify the network
using the `--network` flag:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash -s -- --network testnet
```

Available network options:

- `mainnet` (default)
- `testnet`
- `devnet`

### Features

The installer defaults to downloading a Provisioner node. To install an archive
node, you can use the `--feature` flag:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash -s -- --feature archive
```

You can combine both flags to install a specific network and feature. For
example:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash -s -- --network devnet --feature archive
```

Available feature options:

- `default` (Provisioner node, default)
- `archive` (Archive node)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The installer comes with sane defaults, only requiring minimal configuration.
Before the Rusk service can be started, the `CONSENSUS_KEYS` and
`DUSK_CONSENSUS_KEYS_PASS` need to be provided.

The `CONSENSUS_KEYS` can be either moved to `/opt/dusk/conf/` from another
system or generated on the node itself and moved there.

### üîë Set consensus keys

To generate the consensus keys locally, run `rusk-wallet` and either create a
new wallet or use a recovery phrase with `rusk-wallet restore`.

To generate and export the consensus key-pair and put the `.keys` file in the
right directory with the right name, copy the following command:

```sh
rusk-wallet export -d /opt/dusk/conf -n consensus.keys
```

### üîê Set consensus password

Run the following command and it will prompt you to enter the password for the
consensus keys file:

```sh
sh /opt/dusk/bin/setup_consensus_pwd.sh
```

### ‚Üª Reset Rusk state

To remove old Rusk state and the old wallet cache, simply run:

```sh
ruskreset
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Rusk

Everything should be configured now and the node is ready to run. Use the
following commands:

```sh
service rusk start
```

Check the status of the Rusk service by running:

```sh
service rusk status
```

## üî¢ Check the installer version

To check your installer version, run:

```sh
ruskquery version
```

If you're running an outdated version of the installer, it will warn you and ask
you to upgrade.

## üîç Diagnostics

Check if your node is syncing, processing and accepting new blocks:

```sh
tail -F /var/log/rusk.log | grep "block accepted"
```

To check the latest block height:

```sh
ruskquery block-height
```

## üîÑ Fast Syncing with Archival State Download

To significantly reduce the time required to sync your node to the latest
published state, you can use the `download_state` command. This command stops
your node and replaces its current state with the latest published state from
one of Dusk's archival nodes. Currently this is only available for mainnet.

To see the available published states, run:

```sh
download_state --list
```

### Using the Fast Sync Command

1. Stop your node (if it's running):
   ```sh
   service rusk stop
   ```

2. Execute the fast sync command.
   ```sh
   download_state
   ```

   If you want to sync up with a specific state instead of the default one, you
   need to pass the block height of the state you want to syncup with.
   ```sh
   download_state 369876
   ```

   Follow the prompts to confirm the operation.

3. Restart your node:
   ```sh
   service rusk restart
   ```

This process will ensure your node is up-to-date with the latest blockchain
state, allowing you to sync faster and get back to participating in the network
in less time.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are experiencing errors in downloading the state, it might be due to
> some remnants of previous state syncing. Try to clean up with
> `sudo rm /tmp/state.tar.gz`

## Contributing OS Support

The Dusk node installer supports modular installation logic for different Linux distributions. We officially support **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, but you can add support for other distros by contributing an OS-specific script.

### How it works

The installer will automatically detect your OS based on `etc/os-release`, and look for a matching script under `/os/<distro>.sh`.

If found, the script will be sourced to handle:
- Package DB updating and dependency installation (`install_deps`)
- Logrotate configuration (`configure_logrotate`)

If no script is found, the installer exits gracefully with instructions to contribute one.

### How to contribute

1. Duplicate the Ubuntu script:
```sh
cp os/ubuntu.sh os/<your-distro>.sh
```
Replace <your-distro> with your distro's ID from `/etc/os-release`.
2. Update `install_deps` to use your package manager. Update `configure_logrotate` if the path or behavior differs on your OS.
3. Test your script on a fresh instance of your OS.
4. Submit a pull request with the new file.
